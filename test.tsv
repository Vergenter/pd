90244097	uncovering patterns of inter urban trips and spatial interactions from check in data	The article revisits spatial interaction and distance decay from the perspective of human mobility patterns and spatially-embedded networks based on an empirical data set. We extract nationwide inter-urban movements in China from a check-in data set that covers half million individuals and 370 cities to analyze the underlying patterns of trips and spatial interactions. By fitting the gravity model, we find that the observed spatial interactions are governed by a power law distance decay effect. The obtained gravity model also well reproduces the exponential trip displacement distribution. However, due to the ecological fallacy issue, the movement of an individual may not obey the same distance decay effect. We also construct a spatial network where the edge weights denote the interaction strengths. The communities detected from the network are spatially connected and roughly consistent with province boundaries. We attribute this pattern to different distance decay parameters between intra-province and inter-province trips.
90347960	notions of connectivity in overlay networks	\"How well connected is the network?\" This is one of the most fundamental questions one would ask when facing the challenge of designing a communication network. Three major notions of connectivity have been considered in the literature, but in the context of traditional (single-layer) networks, they turn out to be equivalent. This paper introduces a model for studying the three notions of connectivity in multi-layer networks. Using this model, it is easy to demonstrate that in multi-layer networks the three notions may differ dramatically. Unfortunately, in contrast to the single-layer case, where the values of the three connectivity notions can be computed efficiently, it has been recently shown in the context of WDM networks (results that can be easily translated to our model) that the values of two of these notions of connectivity are hard to compute or even approximate in multi-layer networks. The current paper shed some positive light into the multi-layer connectivity topic: we show that the value of the third connectivity notion can be computed in polynomial time and develop an approximation for the construction of well connected overlay networks.
90598645	privacy preserving recommendation system based on groups	Recommendation systems have received considerable attention in the recent decades. Yet with the development of information technology and social media, the risk in revealing private data to service providers has been a growing concern to more and more users. Trade-offs between quality and privacy in recommendation systems naturally arise. In this paper, we present a privacy preserving recommendation framework based on groups. The main idea is to use groups as a natural middleware to preserve usersâ€™ privacy. A distributed preference exchange algorithm is proposed to ensure the anonymity of data, wherein the effective size of the anonymity set asymptotically approaches the group size with time. We construct a hybrid collaborative filtering model based on Markov random walks to provide recommendations and predictions to group members. Experimental results on the MovieLens and Epinions datasets show that our proposed methods outperform the baseline methods, L+ and ItemRank, two state-of-the-art personalized recommendation algorithms, for both recommendation precision and hit rate despite the absence of personal preference information.
90670406	efficient algorithms and error analysis for the modified nystrom method	Many kernel methods suffer from high time and space complexities and are thus prohibitive in big-data applications. To tackle the computational challenge, the Nystr\"om method has been extensively used to reduce time and space complexities by sacrificing some accuracy. The Nystr\"om method speedups computation by constructing an approximation of the kernel matrix using only a few columns of the matrix. Recently, a variant of the Nystr\"om method called the modified Nystr\"om method has demonstrated significant improvement over the standard Nystr\"om method in approximation accuracy, both theoretically and empirically. #R##N#In this paper, we propose two algorithms that make the modified Nystr\"om method practical. First, we devise a simple column selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Our algorithm is more efficient and easier to implement than and nearly as accurate as the state-of-the-art algorithm. Second, with the selected columns at hand, we propose an algorithm that computes the approximation in lower time complexity than the approach in the previous work. Furthermore, we prove that the modified Nystr\"om method is exact under certain conditions, and we establish a lower error bound for the modified Nystr\"om method.
93343750	variance competitiveness for monotone estimation tightening the bounds	Random samples are extensively used to summarize massive data sets and facilitate scalable analytics. Coordinated sampling, where samples of different data sets \"share\" the randomization, is a powerful method which facilitates more accurate estimation of many aggregates and similarity measures. We recently formulated a model of {\it Monotone Estimation Problems} (MEP), which can be applied to coordinated sampling, projected on a single item. MEP estimators can then be used to estimate sum aggregates, such as distances, over coordinated samples. For MEP, we are interested in estimators that are unbiased and nonnegative. We proposed {\it variance competitiveness} as a quality measure of estimators: For each data vector, we consider the minimum variance attainable on it by an unbiased and nonnegative estimator. We then define the competitiveness of an estimator as the maximum ratio, over data, of the expectation of the square to the minimum possible. We also presented a general construction of the L$^*$ estimator, which is defined for any MEP for which a nonnegative unbiased estimator exists, and is at most 4-competitive. #R##N#Our aim here is to obtain tighter bounds on the {\em universal ratio}, which we define to be the smallest competitive ratio that can be obtained for any MEP. We obtain an upper bound of 3.375, improving over the bound of $4$ of the L$^*$ estimator. We also establish a lower bound of 1.44. The lower bound is obtained by constructing the {\it optimally competitive} estimator for particular MEPs. The construction is of independent interest, as it facilitates estimation with instance-optimal competitiveness.
